 * Where the Inbox gets its messages.

 * <p>The same job `lib/backups.ts` does for the Backups screen and `lib/users.ts`
 * for the user list: one place the page asks, so the page never knows whether
 * the answer came from a backend, a file or — as today — an invented sample.
 * When the API arrives, the body of {@link getInbox} becomes an `apiFetch` call
 * and nothing on the screen changes.
 *
 * <p>Async already, for that reason. A synchronous function here would mean the
 * page's `await` appears on the day the backend does, and a change that touches
 * the page as well as this file is a change that can break the page.
 *
 * <p><b>Filtering and searching happen here, not in the list.</b> Narrowing in
 * the browser means every message has to be sent before any of them can be
 * hidden — fine at five, wrong at five thousand, and the wrong shape to hand a
 * backend later. The same split the user list already uses.
