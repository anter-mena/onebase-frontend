 *
 * <p>Deliberately not random, for the same two reasons `backupSample` is not: it
 * is generated on the server and handed to components as props, so anything
 * non-deterministic would render one thing on the server and another in the
 * browser and React would flag the mismatch. And a design preview wants a
 * <em>range</em> — a long message and a short one, a subject that fits and one
 * that does not, some read and some not — because the point is to check that all
 * of them survive the same layout.
 *
 * <p>Delete this file the day the API is real. It should leave no trace in the
 * components, which is why they take a `Mail` and know nothing about where it

    body: `I have an important announcement to make during our team meeting. It pertains to a strategic shift in our approach to the upcoming product launch, and it will affect how each of us plans the next quarter.

The short version is that we are moving the launch back by three weeks. That is not a decision anybody enjoyed making, and it was made for one reason: the reliability work we started in June is not finished, and shipping on top of it would mean shipping something we would spend the following quarter apologising for.

What this changes for each team:

Engineering keeps the current sprint and gains one more. Nothing already committed is being cut — the extra time goes to the outstanding reliability items and to the test coverage we have been deferring since March.

Design has three additional weeks on the onboarding flow, which was the piece most obviously rushed in the last review.

Marketing is the team this costs the most, because the campaign was already booked around the original date. We will go through the rebooking together on Thursday rather than by email.

I know a delay is never welcome news, particularly this late. I would rather explain a three-week slip once than explain a bad launch every week for a quarter.

Please bring your questions to the meeting. I would rather answer them in the room than have them discussed in six separate conversations afterwards.`,
