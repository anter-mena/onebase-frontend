/**
 * A filled line chart, drawn by hand rather than by a charting library.
 *
 * <p>It is about thirty lines of path arithmetic against the several hundred
 * kilobytes a chart library adds to the bundle — and this page needs one shape,
 * not a plotting grammar. If the day comes that somebody wants axes, tooltips and
 * zooming, that is the day to reach for a library.
 *
 * <p><b>The SVG is taken out of the flow</b>, absolutely positioned inside a
 * wrapper that owns the size. That is not decoration: an in-flow SVG whose height
 * cannot be resolved falls back to its viewBox ratio — 100 by 40 — so at a
 * thousand pixels wide it drew itself four hundred tall and pushed the card out
 * with it. Out of flow it contributes nothing to sizing, so the wrapper can be
 * given a fixed height or told to fill, and neither can run away.
 *
 * <p>`preserveAspectRatio="none"` lets the chart stretch to whatever width the
 * card is, which is what makes it fluid. The cost is that the stroke would
 * stretch with it and go blurry — `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` is what
 * keeps the line one pixel wide at any width.
