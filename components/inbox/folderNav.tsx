/**
 * The folders, along the navbar instead of down a sidebar.
 *
 * <p>There is no mail sidebar: this application already has one, and a second
 * column of destinations beside the first is two menus competing to be the place
 * you look. Laying the same list along the top costs the labels their vertical
 * rhythm and buys back the width the reading pane wanted.
 *
 * <p><b>Names are never drawn.</b> The labels do not fit beside the mailbox
 * switcher and the filter tabs, and a nav that wraps to two rows is a sidebar
 * lying down. Every folder is an icon; its name and its count live in the
 * tooltip and in the button's own label.
 *
 * <p><b>Collapsing hides the other two.</b> Open, the row is three icons.
 * Collapsed, it is the folder you are in and the arrow to get the rest back —
 * the state that matters on a narrow pane, because the one folder worth showing
 * is the one being read.
 */

/**
 * Icon names arrive as strings and are resolved here.
 *
 * <p>The folders come from the data layer, and a component is not something that
 * survives being sent from a server to a browser — it has to be looked up on the
 * side that draws it. Same reason the sidebar's own nav keeps its icons in
 * TypeScript rather than in the database.
