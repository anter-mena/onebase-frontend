/**
 * The two halves of the inbox: the messages on the left, the open one on the
 * right.
 *
 * <p>Two panes rather than the three the reference design has. The third is a
 * folder rail — Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Junk — and this application already has a
 * sidebar doing that job a few pixels to the left. A second column of
 * destinations beside the first is two menus competing to be the place you look.
 *
 * <p><b>The divider is draggable and remembers where it was put.</b> How wide
 * the list should be is a matter of taste that changes by the hour — scanning a
 * long list wants width, reading one message wants the opposite — so it is not a
 * decision to make once on somebody's behalf.
 */

/**
 * Where the split sits before anybody moves it.
 *
 * <p>The list gets the larger share of the two-thirds it used to give away. A
 * message is prose and prose does not want a wide column — past about seventy
 * characters a line, the eye loses its place coming back — so the reading pane
 * stops benefiting from extra width long before the list does. The list keeps
 * spending it: a subject that fits is a subject nobody has to open to identify.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the reference design's proportions. shadcn's Mail ships
 * `[20, 32, 48]` across three panes, which without its nav rail renormalises to
 * 40 : 60 — close to this, and tried. This is the one that was kept.

/**
 * How far the divider may travel, in pixels.
 *
 * <p><b>Two numbers, not four — and that is the whole point.</b> With exactly two
 * panes filling the width, a maximum on one <em>is</em> the minimum on the other:
 * they are the same edge of the same divider. Writing all four would be two facts
 * stated twice, and the day somebody adjusts one of the pair without the other,
 * the two rules contradict and the library resolves it by whichever clamp runs
 * last. So each pane declares only its floor, and each floor is the other's
 * ceiling by arithmetic rather than by agreement.
 *
 * <p><b>The list's floor is its header row.</b> The mailbox switcher (208px),
 * the three folder icons with the collapse arrow (~120px), the All mail / Unread
 * tabs (~135px) and the padding and gaps between them come to about 510px, so
 * 540px keeps every folder icon visible with a little room to spare. The reading
 * pane's floor is where a message was still worth reading.
 *
 * <p><b>Pixels, not percentages.</b> A list needs a real width to stay readable —
 * a sender, a date and a subject — and 30% of a laptop is not the same thing as
 * 30% of a monitor. The reference design uses 30% here and gets away with it
 * because it is a desktop demo; that same floor is 488px on a 1920 screen and
 * 219px on a 1024 one, and only the first still shows a subject line.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <b>Together these need 1070px, so this screen needs a window of about
 * 1345px before both can be honoured</b> — the sidebar (224px) and the page
 * padding (~50px) take the rest. Below that the group is asked for more room than
 * it has and the library gives way somewhere — the floors stop being floors,
 * quietly, with nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * <p>Collapsing the sidebar to its icons (52px) moves the threshold to about
 * 1170px, so a narrow window is workable rather than broken. If this screen has
 * to work at 1280 with the sidebar open, these numbers are what to revisit first.
