/**
 * Which mailbox you are looking at.
 *
 * <p>Lives in the top navbar rather than inside the inbox, because it answers a
 * question about the whole screen — every message in the list and the one open
 * beside it belong to whatever this says. A control that reframes both panes
 * belongs above both panes.
 *
 * <p><b>One at a time, not several.</b> The reference design shows a tick beside
 * every address, which reads as a set you can pick from rather than a set you
 * can combine. Combining them is a different feature — a unified inbox — and it
 * changes what every row means, because a message would then need to say which
 * mailbox it arrived at. Worth building deliberately if it is wanted, not by
 * making a switcher quietly multi-select.
 *
 * <p>The choice goes in the address bar with everything else on this screen, so
 * a mailbox can be linked to and the Back button returns to the last one.

          attempts at this height did nothing.

          SelectTrigger declares its height as `data-[size=default]:h-8`, so the
          obvious fix was to match that variant. It was the wrong diagnosis:
          <b>neither that class nor any override of it exists in the compiled
          CSS</b> — Tailwind never emitted the variant at all, so the trigger has
          been sized by its `py-2` padding the entire time. Every "make it
          taller" edit was competing with a rule that was not there.

          A plain height class does generate, so this is the one that decides it.
          Set to the same 32px as the folder buttons beside it, since they are one
          row of controls and should read as one scale.

          A set width, not `w-full`. Height was the point — filling the row was
          not, and it left the folder nav squeezed against the edge. Addresses
          truncate rather than the control growing to fit the longest one. */}
